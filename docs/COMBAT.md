# Misthollow Combat Guide

Master the art of combat in Misthollow! This guide covers everything from basic attacks to advanced class mechanics.

---

## ⚔️ Combat Basics

### Starting a Fight

To attack an enemy, use the `kill` command:

```bash
> kill goblin
You attack the goblin warrior!
You hit the goblin warrior for 12 damage!
The goblin warrior swings at you!
The goblin warrior hits you for 8 damage!
```

Combat continues automatically in **rounds** (every 2 seconds) until one side is dead or flees.

### The Combat Round

Each round, both combatants automatically attack. Your character will:
1. Make a basic attack (and extra attacks if you have Second/Third Attack)
2. Apply any active effects or procs
3. Regenerate a small amount of HP/Mana (based on position)

### Hitting and Missing

Your chance to hit depends on:
- **Hit Bonus** (from gear, stats, buffs)
- **Enemy Armor Class** (lower AC = harder to hit)
- **Your Stats** (DEX for accuracy, STR for power)

```
Attack Roll = d20 + Hit Bonus vs Enemy Defense
```

### Damage Calculation

When you hit, damage is calculated:
```
Base Damage (weapon dice) + Damage Bonus + Stat Bonus
```

**Damage Modifiers:**
- Critical hits deal double damage
- Backstab multiplies damage
- Abilities may add percentage bonuses
- Armor reduces incoming damage

---

## 🎯 Understanding Your Stats

| Stat | Combat Benefit |
|------|----------------|
| **STR** | Melee damage bonus, carrying capacity |
| **DEX** | Hit chance, armor class, dodge |
| **CON** | Maximum HP, HP regeneration |
| **INT** | Spell damage (casters), mana pool |
| **WIS** | Spell effectiveness, mana regen |
| **CHA** | Charm effects, vendor prices, bard songs |

### Armor Class (AC)

Lower AC = Better Defense

- Base AC is 100
- Armor reduces AC (leather: -20, plate: -80)
- Buffs like `armor` and `shield` further reduce AC
- Each 10 AC = ~1 defense point

---

## 🗡️ Combat Skills

### Universal Skills

| Skill | Description | Usage |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `kick` | Basic kick attack | `kick` |
| `bash` | Shield bash (may stun) | `bash <target>` |
| `rescue` | Pull enemy off ally | `rescue <ally>` |
| `disarm` | Knock weapon away | `disarm <target>` |

### The Second Attack / Third Attack

Higher-level characters gain extra attacks per round:
- **Second Attack** - 2 attacks per round
- **Third Attack** - 3 attacks per round

These trigger automatically in combat.

### Positioning Skills

| Skill | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `hide` | Become hidden (out of combat) |
| `sneak` | Move without being noticed |
| `backstab` | Attack from hiding for bonus damage |

## ✨ Combat Magic

### Casting in Combat

```bash
> cast fireball goblin
You hurl a fireball at the goblin!
The goblin is engulfed in flames for 45 damage!
```

### Spell Targeting

- **Offensive spells** - Require a target: `cast fireball orc`
- **Defensive spells** - Default to self: `cast armor` or `cast armor thorin`
- **Group spells** - Affect your whole party: `cast group_heal`

### Mana Management

- Spells cost mana
- Mana regenerates over time (faster when resting)
- Out of mana? Use melee attacks or potions!

### Key Combat Spells by Type

```bash
cast cure_light              # Small heal (10 mana)
cast cure_serious            # Medium heal (20 mana)
cast heal                    # Full heal (50 mana)
cast group_heal              # Heal party (80 mana)
```

**Buffs (cast before combat!):**
```bash
cast armor                   # -20 AC
cast shield                  # -10 AC, blocks magic missiles
cast bless                   # +2 hit, +1 damage
