# Rebuild plan — from first real playtest (2026-10-09)

The first real play on frostpine (not a bot, not a critic) found three things wrong. Root causes
in the code:

| complaint | cause |
|---|---|
| combat is horrible | combat resolves on a **4-second round** (`main.py` fires `combat_tick` every `TICKS_PER_SECOND * 4`; `PULSE_VIOLENCE = 2` in config is ignored). You press, then wait for the round. |
| the UI is too large | the camera zooms to **1.3× "fit one room"** (`scene-topdown.js`), so you see less than one room and a 16-px tile is ~68 px on a wide window; world labels scale with it. The HUD is sized for 1280×720. |
| movement between rooms is clunky | rooms are 24×15 tiles (crossed in ~3.5 s), exits are one-tile gaps in the wall middle, and every crossing waits on the server (pending-move lock up to 2.5 s). |

Decisions (owner): real-time action combat; the web client comes first, telnet may lag behind;
order 1 → 2 → 3 → 4. Every phase ships on its own (auto-deploy to frostpine) and is judged by
playing it, not by screenshots.

## Phase 1 — scale and readability
- Camera: zoom to a fixed world view (~34×19 tiles: the room plus its neighbours), not 1.3× one room.
- HUD ~30% smaller on wide screens; a UI-scale setting (S / M / L) remembered per browser.
- World labels (names, damage numbers, LOOT) sized in screen pixels, not world pixels.
- Underground zones (sewers, caves, crypts, mines) render as stone whatever their old sector tag;
  dark rooms say so ("too dark — hold a light"); neighbours of dark rooms are darkened too.
- Done when: a 1920-wide window shows a room and its neighbours with a HUD under ~15% of the screen.

## Phase 1 — status: shipped
Camera shows ~34×19 tiles (2.5× on a 1920 window instead of 4.25×); HUD scale (auto trims wide
windows; Settings → HUD size); smaller LOOT tag; enclosed zones (sewers, mines, crypts…) render
underground whatever their old sector tags; neighbours of dark rooms are dark; a dark room says
"hold a light". Exposed by the wider view: neighbour paintings arrive slowly (100–160 ms each,
thrown away on every room change) — solved structurally in phase 2.

## Phase 2 — movement (owner, after phase 1: "seamless walking between rooms, no room switching")
The zone is ONE map: rooms laid out on the atlas grid, openings where exits connect, walls where
they don't, one physics world, camera follows. Walking into another room's area sends the move to
the server in the background; nothing on screen rebuilds. Creatures and players stand in their
rooms' areas. Room paintings are made around the player progressively (nearest first, lower detail
far away) and kept in a bounded cache. Only a zone change (or up/down) fades.

- (superseded by the one-map design above; kept for the refusal rule) the server confirms in the
  background and only a refusal snaps you back.
- Wide openings: where two rooms connect, the shared wall is open across a third of its length.
- Faster walk; click-to-move with pathing across rooms (the minimap auto-walk, in the world).
- Done when: holding a direction through five rooms never stops the hero.

### Phase 2 — status, step 1 (shipped)
- Measured first: only 80% of in-zone exits land on the adjacent atlas cell and 7 of 59 zones lay
  out cleanly (MUD loops don't close), so a literal one-map-per-zone would break one exit in five.
  The world is therefore stitched AROUND THE PLAYER: every room is placed next to the one it
  connects to as you go, so every exit you walk through is seamless.
- Entering a room reuses the painting already made for the neighbour view (8 ms instead of
  100–160 ms of repaint at every crossing).
- Creatures seen in a neighbouring room stand on the slot they'll use once you walk in (they
  used to jump).
- Openings are 7 tiles on the long walls and 5 on the short ones (were 3), with clear lanes to
  match; all 3012 rooms pass `tools/qc_platformer_rooms.js`.
- Measured and ruled out: the server answers moves instantly (telnet and the websocket bridge);
  the 9 s crossings seen in headless tests are the test machine's ~1 fps software renderer.
- Next: play it on real hardware; if crossings still read as a switch, the remaining step is a
  client-side optimistic crossing (switch at the boundary, confirm in the background).

## Phase 3 — real-time action combat
- Server: replace round resolution for web players with per-action resolution — an attack is a
  request resolved within ~150 ms with its own swing time and cooldown; abilities keep their
  costs and get cooldowns. Mob AI ticks fast (~250 ms) and uses its existing intents as timed
  attacks with a wind-up you can see and leave.
- Client: every press swings immediately (prediction), hits land on the server's answer; floor
  telegraphs for mob attacks you dodge by moving; brace / stagger / perfect strike / interrupt
  become timing on actions, not rounds.
- Telnet keeps the old round loop until it is ported (owner: web first).
- Done when: a fight is decided by what you press and where you stand, second to second.

## Phase 4 — feel
- Hit-stop, knockback, impact sounds, death and respawn flow, then a playtest by the owner.
