"""The marquee quests (push 7): one per class, offered at level 45 by the class's trainer, ending
in a private trial; solo about two hours, harder for each member who embarks.

Offline: the scaling (health, damage, adds, tempo, rewards) by the number who embarked; a solo
quest's foes add up to about two hours with travel; Unbroken Banner is earned, never learned by
level, and its command refuses another class and a running cooldown.
Live (needs ./run.sh and the gauntlet accounts) — see live() below.
