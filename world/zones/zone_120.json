He removes a jeweler's loupe from his eye as he turns around.  'How in the name of Merlin did you get in here??!!' he asks.  'Oh, nevermind!  Since you are here, you can serve as witnesses to the final test of the new mages' spell:  \"ectowatt\".'  With this he makes a magical gesture and a paladin appears.  Crossing his fingers, Froboz waves the wand his direction and what happens next is incredible!  The Paladin is enveloped in what appears to be a small, well contained, thermonuclear explosion.  When the smoke clears you can see that the paladin and all of equipment has been reduced to a large pile of flaming cinders.  Froboz throws his head back and cackles with insane glee.
