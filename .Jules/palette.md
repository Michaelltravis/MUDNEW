## 2024-05-23 - Terminal Accessibility
**Learning:** Terminal-like interfaces in web clients need `role="log"` and `aria-live="polite"` to be announced by screen readers.
**Action:** Always check `div`s used as terminals for these attributes.

## 2024-05-24 - Smart Auto-Scrolling
**Learning:** Terminal output in the web client should implement 'Smart Scroll', where auto-scrolling only occurs if the user is currently at the bottom of the scroll container. To handle high-DPI sub-pixel scrolling differences safely, check if `Math.abs(scrollHeight - scrollTop - clientHeight) < 10`. Also when checking `settings.autoScroll` declared with `let` later, wrap the access in a `try...catch` block to safely handle Temporal Dead Zone errors.
**Action:** Always implement Smart Scroll checking for sub-pixel offsets and TDZ handling for auto-scrolling terminal elements.

## 2024-05-25 - Custom Toggle Switches
**Learning:** Custom toggle buttons (e.g., in settings modals) must implement semantic switch attributes including `role='switch'`, dynamic `aria-checked` states ('true' or 'false'), and explicit labels via `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label`. Otherwise, screen readers don't know the state of the toggle.
**Action:** Always ensure toggle buttons implement ARIA switch semantics.

## 2024-05-26 - Interactive States During Connection
**Learning:** Interactive input elements (like text inputs, send buttons, and quick command buttons) must be visually and programmatically disabled during WebSocket connection initialization and upon connection failure. Users expect to clearly see when interaction is impossible.
**Action:** Use CSS `:not(:disabled)` on hover/active pseudo-classes to prevent interactive visual effects on inactive elements, add styles for `button:disabled, input:disabled`, and update input placeholders to explicitly explain the disabled state (e.g., 'Connecting...', 'Disconnected').
