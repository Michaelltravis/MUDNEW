"""
Auto-generated help for every spell, skill, and talent in Misthollow.

This module is the single source of truth for ability help text. Rather than
hand-maintaining hundreds of entries that drift out of sync with the code, it
*generates* help from the authoritative game data:

  - spells       -> spells.SPELLS               (mana/level/damage/affects/...)
  - talent trees -> talents.CLASS_TALENT_TREES  (per-talent descriptions)
  - class lists  -> config.Config.CLASSES       (who learns what)
  - skills       -> SKILL_PROSE (curated below) + class ownership

Curated prose layers nuance on top of the raw stats (how to *use* an ability,
combos, resource mechanics) where the numbers alone don't tell the story.
Everything else is described from its data so coverage is total.

`build_ability_help()` returns a {topic: entry} dict in the same shape as
help_data.HELP_TOPICS, and help_data merges it in at import time.
