"""The marquee abilities: one per class, earned through its class's quest (marquee.py), never by
level (owner: "Each class should have a final marquee spell/skill/ability ... a quest for each
character").

Each is a command (cmd_<id>) put on the CommandHandler before mastery.install(), so gating
("you earn it through ..."), the action bar and learning by use work as for any ability. They
are strong alone and party-wide in a group; their damage and healing follow how well they are
known (mastery.power) and the hero's level (marquee_scale.dpr: about what a hero deals in a
round); their long cooldowns are kept on the character (`marquee_cd`, saved).

  Warrior — Unbroken Banner: foes beside you reel and every foe turns on you; for five rounds
            you and your allies deal 25% more, shake off stuns and fear and mend.
  Mage — Singularity: every foe is pulled to one point and held while it crushes them for two
            rounds, then it implodes and leaves them slowed.
  Cleric — Seraph's Vigil: a seraph heals the most wounded ally each round for six rounds; while
            it stands each ally survives one killing blow.
  Paladin — Wings of Dawn: you rise on wings of light and crash down: radiant damage around you,
            and every ally healed and shielded.
  Necromancer — Lich Ascension: six rounds as a lich: spells cost half, soul bolts split to a
            second foe, what you deal drains back to you, and death is turned away once.
  Thief — The Heist of Ages: gone in smoke and behind every foe at once: each is struck and
            relieved of half its gold, and the next three swings land as criticals.
  Ranger — Heartseeker: a breath to draw, then one arrow through every foe on its line; they
            take more for four rounds and are held where they stand.
  Bard — Song of the Ages: five rounds in which allies' abilities come back twice as fast and
            they deal and heal a fifth more, while foes slow; the last note stuns them.
  Assassin — Thousand Shadows: for three rounds shadows strike every foe; the last of them
            finishes the weakest (bosses take a heavier blow instead).

What lasts beyond the command runs on combat rounds (`EFFECTS`, stepped by `on_round` after
every World.combat_tick), only while its caster is online, in the room it began in and alive.
Bosses are never pulled, rooted, slowed or stunned: they stagger instead. Nothing here touches
players as foes: `_foes` are creatures fighting you or your group that you may harm.
