"""Real-time combat for the 3D client.

A web player whose /play client asks for it (its map socket subscribes with combat:'action', a
Settings toggle that is on by default) fights on their own clock instead of the 3-s round:

- each combatant has a swing clock, `next_swing_at`, set whenever it takes a turn (by the round
  wrapper in combat_hooks, in either mode);
- the blow lands the moment attack is pressed if the clock is ready (`webattack`), then every
  SWING seconds while the foe is in reach (the 200 ms action tick swings for you);
- skills and spells resolve at once behind a GCD-second global cooldown ("Not ready yet.");
- a creature fighting such a player acts on its own staggered clock too: a turn every
  MOB_EVERY s (± MOB_JITTER; the first a moment after it engages) in the order a round would
  give it (declare a wind-up, specials, its swing), and a wind-up lands WINDUP s after it is
  declared, checked every tick, so it can be stepped out of.

SWING is today's round, so damage per second is unchanged and every balance number holds.
Everything that counts in rounds (rituals, pets, a companion, a burning mount, marquee effects)
stays on the 3-s round; the round leaves out only the swings action mode makes. Telnet and the
2D client keep the round. Config.ACTION_COMBAT = False turns all of it off.
