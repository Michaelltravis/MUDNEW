"""Structured combat events for the graphical (3D) client.

Every swing, hit, miss, defence, cast, heal, death and wind-up is also emitted as a small
JSON event from the same code that prints its combat-log line, so the client can animate
exactly what the log says. Events emitted during one moment are batched per room and sent
on the map socket as {"type": "combat_events", "room": vnum, "events": [...]} to the web
clients of everyone standing in that room. Telnet players are unaffected.

Event shape (all fields optional except k):
  k       attack | ability | spell | heal | buff | debuff | windup | resolve | death | stun | oor
  src/dst {"p": player name} or {"m": mob uid}
  res     hit | crit | miss | dodge | parry | block | resist | immune
  amt     damage or healing amount
  ability / spell, school (fire, frost, lightning, arcane, holy, shadow, necrotic, nature,
  poison, sound, physical, blood), ranged (bool), area {shape, r, angle, x, z}, ms (wind-up)
